# Quantum Random Number Generator 

## Project Description

A number/password generator using quantum computers.

## Stack

* Python
* Qiskit

## Possible Security Vulnerability

If you choose to use this software for password generation, please do not share your IBMid API token and/or Job ID. 
Sharing these details could allow unauthorized individuals to access job results, potentially compromising your password security.

## To Be Implemented

* Maximum number handling (num_random, len_password, num_password).
    * Possibly with Qiskit Batch.
* Flexibility in number of qubits + random number range.
* Password ASCII letters / digits / special characters.
* Command line parser.
* Executable build.
